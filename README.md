This Java application is a basic login and registration system using JavaFX for the user interface, JDBC for database interaction, and BCrypt for password hashing.

 - Login Functionality: Users can log in by entering a username and password. The application verifies the password against a hashed version stored in the database.

 - Registration Functionality: New users can register by providing a username and password. The password is hashed using BCrypt before being stored in the database.

 - User Interface: The application features a simple graphical user interface with JavaFX, including a login form, a registration form, and error handling for empty fields and incorrect credentials.

- Database: It uses JDBC to interact with an SQL database for storing and retrieving user credentials.
